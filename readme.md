# FAQ_UE_Chatbot

Super excited to build this project! ðŸš€ This is a FAQ-based chatbot with a fun and reality-based approach. It will provide all the necessary information in a humorous yet accurate way.

### What can you learn from this?

- How to create an FAQ-based AI chatbot for any website
- How to develop a topic-specific text-generative chatbot
- No need for a static FAQ sectionâ€”just add this chatbot and boost your websiteâ€™s engagement!

### What will this chatbot do?

It will answer all the common questions asked by new admission students or those applying to the **University of Education, Lahore**. The responses will be funny but always correct!

ðŸš« No Hugging Face, no OpenAI APIâ€”this is built manually from scratch! (Exciting, right? At least for me, it is! ðŸ˜†)
# Final Result is here:
You can ask as many questions as you want(But only related to UE):

(So don't forget to try it)
